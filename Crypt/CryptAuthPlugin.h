/**
 * Called by the plugin host to create a mechanism, that is, a specific
 * instance of authentication.
 *
 * inPlugin is the plugin reference, that is, the value returned by
 * AuthorizationPluginCreate.
 *
 * inEngine is a reference to the engine that's running the plugin.
 * We need to keep it around because it's a parameter to all the
 * callbacks.
 *
 * mechanismId is the name of the mechanism.  When you configure your
 * mechanism in "/etc/authorization", you supply a string of the
 * form:
 *
 *   plugin:mechanism[,privileged]
 *
 * where:
 *
 * o plugin is the name of this bundle (without the extension)
 * o mechanism is the string that's passed to mechanismId
 * o privileged, if present, causes this mechanism to be
 *   instantiated in the privileged (rather than the GUI-capable)
 *   plug-in host
 *
 * You can use the mechanismId to support multiple types of
 * operation within the same plugin code.  For example, your plugin
 * might have two cooperating mechanisms, one that needs to use the
 * GUI and one that needs to run privileged.  This allows you to put
 * both mechanisms in the same plugin.
 *
 * outMechanism is a pointer to a place where you return a reference to
 * the newly created mechanism.
